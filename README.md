# HIDESAVERETURN

This REDCap External Module allows users to conditionally hide the Save & Return Later button on surveys using Action Tags and branching logic.

This action tag is used on descriptive text fields whose visibility on the survey will prevent the visibility of the Save & Return Later button.

## Installation

Install the module from the REDCap module repository and enable in the Control Center, then enable on projects.

## Usage

This module adds one action tag:

- @HIDESAVERETURN â€“ Hides the Save and Return Later button on surveys _if the field is visible due to branching logic_.

## Acknowledgements

This external module is basically a clone of the [HIDESUBMIT Action Tags](https://github.com/jangari/redcap_hidesubmit) external module, targeting the Save & Return Later button instead. It was developed after a suggestion from [@lucheng.kuo](https://redcap.vanderbilt.edu/community/profile.php?id=2725) and [@lara.lechtenberg2](https://redcap.vanderbilt.edu/community/profile.php?id=4382) on the REDCap Community.
